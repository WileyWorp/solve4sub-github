# Solve4Sub
Originally built for Wiley Worp to force him to solve a rubik's cube every time he gains subscribers. Now this code is open to anyone to use.
# Requirements
You'll want an account and project on the [Google Developer Website](console.cloud.google.com). It's important that you make a project and find the **Youtube Data API v3** in **APIs & Services** on that page. With this you get the **key** & **username** shown in the first couple lines of app.js.
```
const Key = 'GOOGLE_API_KEY'; // replace with the API key you got from the website
const username = 'USERNAME'; // replace with the string when you go to your youtube channel
```
